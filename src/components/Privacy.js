              PRIVACY POLICY
              <br />‍

            Last Updated: Aug 10<sup>th</sup>, 2022
            <br />
            <br />
            This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of NGL Labs LLC
            (“NGL”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) and how we handle personal information
            that we collect through our application, website and any other sites
            or services (collectively, the “Services”).
            <br />
            <br />‍
            <strong>
              The basics&nbsp;
              <br />‍
            </strong>
            NGL allows users to receive anonymous messages through Instagram.
            This is how it works:
            <br />
            <br />
            The NGL app permits a user (“App User”) to generate an NGL link and
            then use the link to solicit messages from anyone with access to the
            link (the person sending an anonymous message is a “Message
            Sender”).
            <strong>
              &nbsp;
              <br />
              <br />‍
            </strong>
            When a Message Sender clicks on the NGL link, they will be taken to
            a URL where they can send a message directly to the App User. The
            App User also has the choice to post the anonymous messages and App
            User’s response to the App User’s Instagram account.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            NGL does not store the name or Instagram handle of the Message
            Sender, and cannot reveal this information to the App User or to
            others. NGL may reveal properties of the Message Sender to the App
            User, based on the Message Sender’s IP address or browser user
            agent. Additionally, NGL may share this information for compliance,
            safety, and integrity issues.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            To protect the safety of our users, we employ AI content moderation
            services like{" "}
            <a href="https://hivemoderation.com/">Hive Moderation</a>. These
            services utilize deep learning and sophisticated algorithms to
            screen messages and filter out harmful language and bullying.
